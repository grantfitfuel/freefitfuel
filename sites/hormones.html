  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why Hormones Matter</h2>
    <p>Hormones are chemical messengers that coordinate everything from metabolism and energy levels to mood, sleep, and emotional stability. They don’t act in isolation — they interact in a finely tuned rhythm. Chronic stress, poor sleep, ultra-processed diets, and irregular routines can throw that rhythm off balance, resulting in fatigue, brain fog, mood swings, weight fluctuations, digestive issues, and more.</p>
    <p>Supporting healthy hormonal function is about aligning with your body’s natural rhythm — <strong>not forcing it</strong>. Vagus nerve stimulation, daily light exposure, nourishing food, sleep, and mindful movement all help bring the system back into sync.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- CORTISOL -->
  <section>
    <h2>Cortisol — The Stress Regulator</h2>
    <p><strong>Cortisol</strong>, produced by your adrenal glands, is your primary stress hormone. It’s essential for energy, focus, and alertness. Cortisol should peak in the morning and gently decline during the day. Chronic stress or disrupted sleep can lead to <strong>persistent high cortisol</strong> or an inverted rhythm, leaving you feeling wired, exhausted, anxious, or foggy.</p>
    <h3>What High or Dysregulated Cortisol Can Affect:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased abdominal fat storage and insulin resistance</li>
      <li>Sleep disruption (especially difficulty falling asleep)</li>
      <li>Suppressed immune function and increased inflammation</li>
      <li>Lower levels of thyroid and reproductive hormones</li>
      <li>Persistent anxiety, irritability, or brain fog</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- MELATONIN -->
  <section>
    <h2>Melatonin — The Sleep & Recovery Hormone</h2>
    <p><strong>Melatonin</strong> is produced by the pineal gland in response to darkness. It regulates the sleep–wake cycle, lowering body temperature and promoting deep rest. High nighttime cortisol can suppress melatonin production, leading to insomnia or shallow sleep. Exposure to artificial light, especially blue light, can also blunt its release.</p>
    <p>Healthy melatonin production relies on <strong>bright light exposure in the morning</strong> and <strong>dark, calm conditions in the evening</strong>.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- INSULIN -->
  <section>
    <h2>Insulin — The Blood Sugar Balancer</h2>
    <p><strong>Insulin</strong> is released by the pancreas to help move glucose from the blood into cells for energy. High cortisol can make the body less sensitive to insulin, raising blood sugar levels and contributing to energy crashes, cravings, or weight changes.</p>
    <p>Steady, balanced meals with fibre, protein, and healthy fats support healthy insulin response and reduce stress hormone surges.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- THYROID HORMONES -->
  <section>
    <h2>Thyroid Hormones — The Metabolic Thermostat</h2>
    <p>The <strong>thyroid gland</strong> produces T3 and T4 hormones, which set the body’s metabolic pace. Chronic stress can suppress thyroid hormone conversion and receptor sensitivity, resulting in low energy, weight gain, constipation, or low mood. Supporting thyroid health involves regulating stress, getting adequate iodine, selenium, and iron, and maintaining steady sleep rhythms.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- SEX HORMONES -->
  <section>
    <h2>Oestrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone — The Reproductive Hormones</h2>
    <p>These hormones influence libido, menstrual cycles, bone density, energy, and emotional balance. Persistent high cortisol can suppress reproductive hormone production, disrupt menstrual cycles, or lower testosterone. Sleep, stress management, and steady blood sugar all support healthy reproductive hormone balance in all genders.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- MOOD CHEMICALS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Dopamine, Serotonin, Oxytocin & GABA — The Mood Network</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dopamine</strong>: motivation, focus, reward — too low = flat, unmotivated; too high = overstimulation.</li>
      <li><strong>Serotonin</strong>: mood, calm, gut-brain communication. 90% is made in the gut.</li>
      <li><strong>Oxytocin</strong>: the “connection hormone” — boosted by touch, trust, kindness, and community.</li>
      <li><strong>GABA</strong>: a calming neurotransmitter that quietens the nervous system, aiding sleep and focus.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These chemicals respond strongly to <strong>vagus nerve activation</strong>, regular movement, light, nutrition, and social connection.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- VAGUS NERVE -->
  <section>
    <h2>Vagus Nerve Stimulation</h2>
    <p>The <strong>vagus nerve</strong> runs from the brainstem to the heart, lungs, and gut, and plays a critical role in regulating the parasympathetic nervous system. Stimulating it shifts the body from “fight or flight” to “rest and digest,” helping reduce cortisol and balance other hormones indirectly.</p>
    <h3>Daily Techniques:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Slow diaphragmatic breathing:</strong> Inhale 4 s, hold 2 s, exhale 6–8 s.</li>
      <li><strong>Humming or chanting:</strong> Vibrates the vocal cords, stimulating the vagus nerve.</li>
      <li><strong>Gargling:</strong> Activates the throat muscles connected to vagal pathways.</li>
      <li><strong>Cold exposure:</strong> Splash cold water on your face or place a cool pack on the neck.</li>
      <li><strong>Gentle massage:</strong> Behind the ears or along the side of the neck (light pressure only).</li>
      <li><strong>Grounded movement:</strong> Walking, yoga, or tai chi enhance vagal tone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Physiological effects:</strong> lower heart rate, improved heart rate variability, reduced inflammation, calmer mood, and better digestion.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- DAILY STRATEGIES -->
  <section>
    <h2>Daily Hormone Regulation Strategies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Morning:</strong> Get light exposure, breathe slowly, eat balanced meals, avoid skipping breakfast if blood sugar is unstable.</li>
      <li><strong>Midday:</strong> Move gently, stay hydrated, manage caffeine intake.</li>
      <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Dim lights, stimulate the vagus nerve through breathwork, avoid screens an hour before bed, and allow melatonin to rise.</li>
      <li><strong>Throughout the day:</strong> Build rhythm — your hormones respond to regularity.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- MEDICAL SUPPORT -->
  <section>
    <h2>When to Seek Medical Support</h2>
    <p>Hormonal imbalance can have medical causes that need investigation. Speak to your GP or endocrinologist if you experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Severe or persistent fatigue despite rest</li>
      <li>Weight changes that don’t match diet or activity</li>
      <li>Hair loss or skin changes</li>
      <li>Irregular or absent menstrual cycles or low libido</li>
      <li>Chronic sleep disruption</li>
      <li>Low mood, anxiety, or difficulty regulating emotions</li>
    </ul>
